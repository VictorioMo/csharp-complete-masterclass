# 🧾 C# Cheat Sheets

This folder contains personal (AI generated) and course-generated **C# quick-reference sheets** created while following the *Complete C# Masterclass*.  
Each document focuses on one topic — from syntax and OOP to debugging and clean code — and includes explanations, examples, and small insights.
