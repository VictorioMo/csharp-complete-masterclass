# 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Demo Project

This project is a small demonstration of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices in C#.  
It was built as part of the **C# Masterclass course** to practice writing tests first, implementing just enough code to pass them, and then refactoring.

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Project

The main focus is not the application itself, but to **showcase the TDD workflow** and related practices:

- ✅ **Write the first failing test** before any implementation.
- ✅ **Refactor and add domain logic** step by step.
- ✅ **Integrate a simple Web API** to demonstrate how TDD scales to application layers.
- ✅ **Use the Test First approach** to guide development.
- ✅ **Improve test readability** with assertion messages.
- ✅ **Leverage Fluent Assertions** for cleaner, more expressive test code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **C# / .NET**
- **xUnit** (depending on setup)
- **FluentAssertions**
- **ASP.NET Core Web API** (for demonstration)

## 🚦 TDD Workflow Used

1. **Red** – Write a failing test.  
2. **Green** – Implement the simplest code to pass the test.  
3. **Refactor** – Improve the code while keeping tests green.
