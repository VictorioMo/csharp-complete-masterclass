# 🧠 C# Complete Masterclass

This repository is my **learning journey through the “Complete C# Masterclass”** course by Denis Panjuta.  
It contains exercises, challenges, and small projects built while studying C#, .NET, and WPF — all organized by sections and continuously refined with clean code practices.

---

## 📘 Overview

I created this repo to:
- Learn C# from fundamentals to advanced topics (OOP, WPF, LINQ, SQL, JSON, APIs, Unity)
- Build and document my progress transparently
- Apply **clean code**, **SOLID**, and **TDD** principles in small projects
- Gradually move toward **.NET**, **Unity**, and **game development**
- Practice with Git version control

This is not just a study repo — it’s a growing portfolio of how I learn, write, and improve code.
