# Clean Code ‚Äì SOLID Principles

The **SOLID principles** are a set of five design guidelines in object-oriented programming that make code more **maintainable, flexible, and scalable**.  
They were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and are considered essential for writing clean, professional software.

## üîπ What SOLID Stands For
1. [**S ‚Äì Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**](SOLID-SRP.md)  
   A class should have only one reason to change.  

2. [**O ‚Äì Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**](SOLID-OCP.md)  
   Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.  

3. [**L ‚Äì Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**](SOLID-LSP.md)  
   Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.  

4. [**I ‚Äì Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**](SOLID-ISP.md)  
   Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don‚Äôt use.  

5. [**D ‚Äì Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**](SOLID-DIP.md)  
   Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

## üìù Summary
SOLID principles help developers avoid **tight coupling** and **rigid code structures**.  
By applying these principles, you can build systems that are easier to **understand, test, and extend**.
